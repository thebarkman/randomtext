So I’m on my journey trying out Gatsby + Github for my blogging purposes. 
So far, it’s a pretty neat experience. Sure, workflow isn’t as easy as in Ghost. 

## Markdown editor.
Went on a hunt for a decent markdown editor and I think Ghostwiter might be it. It fulfill my needs and best of it all, it’s free. Beat that!
